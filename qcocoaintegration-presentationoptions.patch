Subject: OS X: Fix available geometry at startup when menu bar is hidden

Later versions of OS X allow you to auto-hide the menu bar, which should
free up 22 pixels vertically at the top of the screen in the available
geometry. Due to how the NSScreens are invalidated (asynchronously), we
pick up this geometry change too late, resulting in QWindows maximizing
as if the menu bar was still there.

To work around this we explicitly tell the system to apply the default
presentation options before initializing the QScreen properties, which
results in the NSScreen being invalidated synchronously and having the
right available geometry.
